Once upon a time, a guy made a game like this for personal computers.
Now, he is one of the 10 richest people in the world.
Could this work for me? Only time will tell ...

From the main menu, select a game mode or press left for info.
Press either action button to change lanes and avoid the mules in the road.

In game mode A, the game is played in rounds; making it to the right of the screen will award a point, and getting hit will award a point to the mule. This continues until you quit by pressing the left button.

In Game B, you will endlessly dodge mules until you hit one. You can also press left here to quit.

That's pretty much it!
